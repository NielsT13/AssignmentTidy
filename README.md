# AssignmentTidy
Run 'run_analysis.R' to create a tidy dataset with the mean per subject and per activity for all mean and standerd deviation variables. 
Make sure all the data is in the repository. 
Workflow:
* Data is read in
* Variable names and labels are read in and assigned
* 1 general dataset is created out of test and train datasets
* select only required mean and std variables
* calculate mean per subject and per activity
